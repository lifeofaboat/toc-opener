This file serves as brainstorming buffer for ideas to improve and enhance OpENer:

* New Features:
  - Change of State and application triggered connections
  - Implementation of common CIP-objects
  - CIP-Sync
  - CIP-Motion


* Improvements and Optimizations
  - Remove the need for the response buffer in the explicit message handling (zero copy stack)
  - Rework I/O message handling:
     - own buffers for each connection that are preconfigured and only runtime data needs to be changed.
     - Use only one single outgoing UDP socket for I/O messages

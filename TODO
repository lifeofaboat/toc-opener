This file serves as brainstorming buffer for ideas to improve and enhance OpENer:

* New Features:
  - Change of State and application triggered connections
  - Implementation of common CIP-objects
  - CIP-Sync
  - CIP-Motion


* Improvements and Optimizations
  - Rework data serialization for the GetAttribute services
  - Test exclusive owner connections (inputs/outputs)
  - Remove the need for the response buffer in the explicit message handling 
  	(zero copy stack)
  - Rework I/O message handling:
     - own buffers for each connection that are preconfigured and only runtime 
       data needs to be changed.
     - Use only one single outgoing UDP socket for I/O messages  
     
     
* Documentation
  - Write general documentation section: 
      - Using OpENer in Products
      - Extending OpENer

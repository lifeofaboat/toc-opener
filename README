==================
OpENer Version 1.0
==================

Welcome to OpENer!

OpENer is an EtherNet/IP(TM) stack for I/O adapter devices; supports multiple 
I/O and explicit connections; includes objects and services to make EtherNet/IP-
compliant products defined in THE ETHERNET/IP SPECIFICATION and published by 
ODVA (www.odva.org).

Requirements:
=============
OpENer has been developed to be highly portable. The default version targets PCs
with a POSIX operating system and a BSD-socket network interface. To test this 
version we recommend a Linux PC or Windows with Cygwin (www.cygwin.com) 
installed. You will need to have the following installed:

 gcc, make, binutils, etc. 
 
for normal building. These should be installed on most Linux installations and
are part of the development packages of cygwin.

For the development itself we recommend the use of Eclipse with the CTD plugin 
(www.eclipse.org).

Compile for PCs:
================
  1. Directly in the shell:
     1.1 Go into the bin/pc directory
     1.2 Invoke make
     1.3 For invoking opener type:
          ./opener.exe ipaddress subnetmask gateway domainname hostaddress macaddress
         e.g. ./opener.exe 192.168.0.2 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1 test.com testdevice 00 15 C5 BF D0 87 
  2. Within Eclipse 
     2.1 Import the project
     2.2 Go to the bin/pc folder in the make targets view
     2.3 Choose all from the make targets
     2.4 The resulting executable will be in the directory
        ./bin/pc

====================
OpENer Version 1.2.0
====================

Welcome to OpENer!

OpENer is an EtherNet/IP(TM) stack for I/O adapter devices; supports multiple 
I/O and explicit connections; includes objects and services to make EtherNet/IP-
compliant products defined in THE ETHERNET/IP SPECIFICATION and published by 
ODVA (www.odva.org).

Requirements:
=============
OpENer has been developed to be highly portable. The default version targets PCs
with a POSIX operating system and a BSD-socket network interface. To test this 
version we recommend a Linux PC or Windows with Cygwin (www.cygwin.com) 
installed. You will need to have the following installed:

 gcc, make, binutils, etc. 
 
for normal building. These should be installed on most Linux installations and
are part of the development packages of cygwin.

For the development itself we recommend the use of Eclipse with the CTD plugin 
(www.eclipse.org).

Compile for PCs:
================
  1. Directly in the shell:
     1.1 Go into the bin/pc directory
     1.2 Invoke make
     1.3 For invoking opener type:
          ./opener ipaddress subnetmask gateway domainname hostaddress macaddress
         e.g. ./opener 192.168.0.2 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1 test.com testdevice 00 15 C5 BF D0 87 
  2. Within Eclipse 
     2.1 Import the project
     2.2 Go to the bin/pc folder in the make targets view
     2.3 Choose all from the make targets
     2.4 The resulting executable will be in the directory
        ./bin/pc

Directory structure:
====================
  - bin ...  The resulting binaries and make files for different ports (currently only pc)
  - doc ...  Doxygen generated documentation (has to be generated for the SVN version) and Coding rules
  - data ... EDS file for the default application
  - src
     - cip ... the CIP layer of the stack
     - enet_encap ... the Ethernet encapsulation layer
     - ports ... the platform specific code

Documentation:
==============
The documentation of the functions of OpENer is part of the source code. The source 
packages contain the generated documentation in the directory doc/api_doc. If you 
use the SVN version you will need the program Doxygen for generating the HTML 
documentation. You can generate the documentation by invoking doxygen from the 
command line in the opener main directory.

Porting OpENer:
===============
For porting OpENer to new platforms please see the porting section in the 
Doxygen documentation.
